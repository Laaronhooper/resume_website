 <p class="blog_p">Time is one of the few consistent things in life. It, alongside space and matter are what make up the physical universe. But if you ask anyone, at some point in their lives it’s “flown” or has passed so “slow”. But in reality we know this isn’t true. Our perception of time however is integral when dealing with machine learning algorithms in which time is a key parameter. As creatures of habit we’ve all groaned at the thought of work on Monday, and also longed for Summer break. We deal with time in various different manners. To boil it down I’d say we deal with it in three differing ways. In cycles, blocks and in an absolute sense. Cycles can be seen in a day to day, week to week and even season to season. Once one day ends, it almost starts all over again, putting us back through the exact same hours. 6am feels the same, day after day, week after week. But what’s key about cycles is that it’s understood in the context of the cycle before it. Summer is understood in the context of spring just been and autumn ahead, and in hindsight of the summer before and the summer ahead. We understand it in a cycle. Time as a blocks on the other hand, is understood for the individual time frame itself. “Monday’s” for example aren’t understood in light of Sunday and Tuesday. Rather are understood through the lens of all Mondays before it. Seperate from its cyclical nature. And lastly time seen in an absolute sense. Understanding time in an absolute sense gives weight to the past and the future in which cycles and blocks will undoubtedly occur, but can give us better contrast from the beginning of what we’re measuring to present day. In my next few blog post’s I will be exploring what these three concepts to better understand how it applies to our neural networks.</p>
