            <h1>CYCLICAL UNDERSTANDING OF TIME</h1>
            <p class="blog_p">We’ve spoken about time in terms of its cyclical nature as well as its block like nature. The last kind of nature time as is probably its most understandable form. That is in terms of it being an absolute. Time may have cyclical features and may appear to have blocks, but at its core it is a metaphysical constant of the universe. Always increasing in value never decreasing. You could very easily picture it in a straight line, getting further and further away from its origin.One form of officially encoding this time is in what’s called “unix time” that is the number of seconds that have elapsed since the Unix epoch, minus leap seconds. The only issue with this formatting of time, is deciding when to start it.</p>
