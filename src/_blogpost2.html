                <h1>CYCLICAL UNDERSTANDING OF TIME</h1>

            <p class="blog_p">Time is very easily understood in terms of cycles. With each revolution of earth on it's axis we understand time in terms of hours, minutes. With each lap around the sun we understand years and decades. Its easy to understand as a human. But how can this be represented for a computer to understand. Using a single digits such as 1-7 to interpret days of the week may appear as an easy solution, however when the computer is evaluating this data it doesnâ€™t understand from their that 1 and 8 should both represent the same value. Or that 1 is closer to 7 than it is to 3. One clever way of working around this is through the use of two seperate values that work in tandem to represent cyclical features. Sine and Cosine. This is as Sine approaches 0 Cosine approaches 1 and the reverse is also true.</p>
